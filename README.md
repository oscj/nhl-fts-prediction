# nhl-over-under

This repository holds implementations of several machine learning models and algorithms to predict the total number of goals of a given NHL game.

This project was created as a term project for CMPUT466 (Machine Learning) at the University of Alberta in the Fall of 2021. 

The name of this repository, _nhl_over_under_, alludes that this is an idea that can be integrated with over-under sports betting strategies.
